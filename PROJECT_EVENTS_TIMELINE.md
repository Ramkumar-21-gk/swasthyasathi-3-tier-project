## 8. Event Dependencies & Constraints

### Hard Dependencies (Must complete before next event)

- E-002 → E-003 (Requirements before architecture)
- E-003 → E-004 (Design before tech stack decision)
- E-004 → E-006/E-007/E-008 (Tech stack before development)
- E-019/E-020/E-021 → E-025 (Parallel testing before final integration)
- E-025 → E-029 (Testing complete before production release)

### Soft Dependencies (Recommended sequence)

- E-005 (Design review) before E-006/E-007/E-008 (Development start)
- E-014 (Test planning) before E-019 (Integration testing)

### Resource Constraints

- Backend/Frontend/AI teams cannot exceed 7 developers
- Single DevOps person for all infrastructure
- Limited Groq API quota (rate limiting considerations)
